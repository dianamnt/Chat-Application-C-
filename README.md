A chat application based on the observer pattern. GUI made in QT.
Side note: when you run the app all windows representing the users will open in the same place on the screen, therefore in order to see all users just move the window.
This version of the app has only 4 users but you can add them in the main.cpp file. I will upload an updated version of this project which provides a login feature which will enable adding an undefined number of users when used.
